# Welcome to the Bitcoin Protocol Development Study Groups

*These study groups assume a basic level of Bitcoin protocol knowledge. If you haven't reviewed [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) or [Programming Bitcoin](https://github.com/jimmysong/programmingbitcoin) you should begin there before starting with these resources.*

## Discussion Questions

1. Do you think a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin is a good idea? (Satoshi's description of script)
1. What is the difference between the block propagation network and the transaction relay network? How does participating in one or the other impact your definition of a full node? (Bitcoin Security Models)
1. Define the differences between a full node, pruned node and an SPV? (Bitcoin Security Models)
1. How do you judge the merits or value of a good project/experiment? (If I'd Known What We Were Starting)
1. Do you believe that bitcoin needs to be competitive with visa/mastercard to succeed? (A trip to the moon requires a rocket with multiple stages)
1. How might the community react to a centralized payment processor that does as many transactions per second as these networks? (A trip to the moon requires a rocket with multiple stages)
